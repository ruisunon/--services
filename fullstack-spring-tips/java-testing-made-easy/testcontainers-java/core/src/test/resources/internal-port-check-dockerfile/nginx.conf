# This configuration makes Nginx listen on port port 8080

server {
    # Port 8080 is necessary to prove that the command formatting in the /proc/net/tcp* check uses the correct casing for hexadecimal numbers (i.e. 1F90 and not 1f90)
    listen       8080;
    # Port 100 is necessary to ensure that the /proc/net/tcp* check also succeeds with trailing zeros in the hexadecimal port
    listen       100;
