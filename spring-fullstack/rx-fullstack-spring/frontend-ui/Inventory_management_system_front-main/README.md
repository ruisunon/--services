## About project

An inventory management system is a system whose main task is to speed up the organization's operations.
Organizations whose business is based on raw materials make enormous efforts to be as efficient as possible
using materials following their needs and requirements. On such occasions, the organization
must perform a series of tasks and operations to successfully run its business without an automated
